{"name":"Space Invaders","tagline":"Terminal Space Invaders written in Go","body":"# Space Invaders\r\nTerminal Space Invaders game written in Go.\r\n\r\n![Screenshot 1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/asib/spaceinvaders/master/screen_1.png)\r\n![Screenshot 2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/asib/spaceinvaders/master/screen_2.png)\r\n\r\n#### Joystick bug\r\n\r\nI've just found out that Ubuntu recognises my Microsoft keyboard as both a keyboard and a joystick,\r\nmeaning it creates `/dev/input/js0` despite the fact that there is no joystick connected.\r\nThe result is that the data read from this input can cause unwanted key press events in the game,\r\nmaking it unplayable.\r\n\r\nThe quickfix is to simply `sudo rm /dev/input/js0`.\r\n\r\nAlternatively you can establish a rule for `js0`.\r\n\r\n#### Installation\r\n```sh\r\ngo get -u github.com/asib/spaceinvaders\r\ncd $GOPATH/src/github.com/asib/spaceinvaders\r\ngo build\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can also simply download a binary for your OS/Arch from [here](https://github.com/asib/spaceinvaders/releases).\r\n\r\n#### Controls\r\n\r\n* Use the arrow keys to move left/right, spacebar to fire.\r\n* Press `q` at any time to quit.\r\n\r\nThe game will adjust the number of \"invaders\" to (roughly) fit your terminal's screen size.\r\nThis means you can make the game more/less difficult by making your screen bigger/smaller.\r\n__Just make sure you don't resize the screen once you've started playing__, else the game will crash.\r\n\r\n__If you're having trouble fitting all the graphics onto your terminal screen, even when it's maximised, lower your font size__.\r\n","google":"UA-37134298-2","note":"Don't delete this file!
